- **Lightweight**: Minimal system resources usage
- **Windows Integration**: Uses native Windows API for accurate key state detection

## üéØ Use Cases

- **Accessibility**: Visual confirmation for users who can't see keyboard LEDs
- **Remote Work**: Monitor key states when using external keyboards without indicators
- **Gaming**: Quick glance at lock key states during gameplay
- **Productivity**: Avoid typing errors due to unexpected Caps Lock activation

## üöÄ Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites
- Windows OS (7/8/10/11)
- Python 3.6 or higher
- tkinter (usually comes with Python)

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kazi-abdullah-al-hasnaine/keystate-monitor.git
   cd keystate-monitor
   ```

2. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python keystate_monitor.py
   ```

3. **Or create an executable** (optional):
   ```bash
   pip install pyinstaller
   pyinstaller --onefile --windowed keystate_monitor.py
   ```

### No Installation Required
Simply download the Python file and run it directly - no additional dependencies needed!

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### Architecture
- **GUI Framework**: tkinter (native Python GUI)
- **Windows API**: ctypes.windll for key state detection
- **Animation System**: Custom animation handlers for smooth transitions
- **Threading**: Non-blocking UI updates

### Key Components
- **ModernKeyFrame**: Custom widget for each lock key display
- **KeySentinelApp**: Main application controller
- **Windows API Integration**: Direct system calls for accurate key state reading

### Virtual Key Codes Used
- `0x14` - Caps Lock
- `0x90` - Num Lock  
- `0x91` - Scroll Lock

## üé® Customization

The application uses a carefully designed color scheme:
- **Background**: `#1e1e2f` (Dark blue-gray)
- **Cards**: `#363950` (Medium gray)
- **Active State**: `#4ecdc4` (Teal)
- **Inactive State**: `#ff6b6b` (Coral red)
- **Text**: `#ffffff` / `#e6e6e6` (White/Light gray)

You can easily modify colors, fonts, and animations by editing the respective variables in the code.

## üîß Configuration

### Polling Rate
Default: 200ms (5 times per second)
```python
self.root.after(200, self.update_status)  # Change 200 to desired milliseconds
```

### Window Size
Default: 400x320 pixels
```python
self.root.geometry("400x320")  # Modify as needed
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Application doesn't start**:
- Ensure Python 3.6+ is installed
- Check if tkinter is available: `python -c "import tkinter"`

**Key states not updating**:
- Run as administrator (some systems require elevated privileges)
- Check if Windows API calls are blocked by security software

**Display issues**:
- Update graphics drivers
- Try running with `--disable-gpu` flag if using compiled version
